##Task

The program program should calculate and display the average monthly rainfall, the total rainfall for the year, the highest and lowest temperatures for the year and (the months they occurred in), and the average of all the monthly average temperatures.

##Summary

This program was built using c++ and I chose to use Visual Studio to accomplish this task due to its powerful developer tooling.

##Functionality

The program uses an array of 12 structures to hold weather data for an entire year. When the program runs, it asks the user to enter data (Total Rainfall, High Temperature, Low Temperature) for each month. Once the data are entered for all the months, the program should calculate and display the average monthly rainfall, the total rainfall for the year, the highest and lowest temperatures for the year and (the months they occurred in), and the average of all the monthly average temperatures.
